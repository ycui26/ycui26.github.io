I am a final year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by Dr. [Man Hon Cheung](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~mhcheung/index.htm). From September 2021 to May 2022, I was a research assistant in Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), advised by Dr. [Jian Liu](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jliu/). I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology (double major in Finance) from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in June 2021.
